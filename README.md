# Project: Flight Booker

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/building-advanced-forms)

*"In this project, we’ll be creating a one-way flight booker. You’ll get lots of practice populating and building dropdown menus, radio buttons, and nested submissions. In this case, we’ll build the first three steps of a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight."*

A typical airline booking flow:

    1 - Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
    2 - Choose from among a list of eligible flights
    3 - Enter passenger information for all passengers
    4 - Enter billing information

For the purposes of this project, disregard step 4 and complete steps 1, 2 and 3. Let the fun begin!

Status: in progress.
